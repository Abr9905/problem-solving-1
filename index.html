    There are n colors of socks in a sock drawer. You want to find a pair of
    socks that are the same color. How many socks must you take out to be sure
    of having a pair of the same color?
  </p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>N is the number of colored socks with +1 as the first pull.</p>
  <p>Result: As there are more sock colors added, the amount of pulls needs for a pair changes. </p>
